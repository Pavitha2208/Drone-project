# Semi-Autonomous Drone Management Software for Harbour Operations

This project is a software system developed for managing semi-autonomous drone operations in harbour zones.  
The software enables users to assign cargo or goods to be transported by a drone, monitor missions, and support safe navigation using image-based obstacle detection.

It acts as a control, monitoring, and decision-support layer for drone-assisted cargo and inspection activities in restricted and sensitive environments such as harbours.

## Core Software Functions
- Cargo and goods assignment to drones
- Semi-autonomous mission handling
- Role-based access (User and Operator)
- Mission and task management
- Live monitoring interface
- Image-based obstacle detection support
- AI-assisted alerts for navigation and safety
- Mission status tracking and history

## Use Case: Harbour Zone
- Operation in obstacle-dense environments
- Support for cargo transfer in harbour areas
- Visual inspection and obstacle awareness
- Improved safety in semi-autonomous drone movement

## Software Architecture Overview
- Web-based control and monitoring interface
- Centralized task and cargo management
- Image-processing support for obstacle detection
- Modular and scalable software design

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Routing: React Router
- State Management: Context API
- Styling: CSS
- Version Control: Git and GitHub

## How to Run the Software
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the application using `npm start`
4. Open the software at `http://localhost:3000`

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how software can support semi-autonomous drone cargo operations with obstacle detection in harbour environments, improving operational efficiency and safety.

## Application Scope
